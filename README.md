# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Yellow Taxi Trip Dataset

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The dataset comes from Kaggle: TLC Trip Record Data – Yellow Taxi.

🔍 What’s inside:

1. Checking dataset structure and data types (df.info())

2. Handling missing values (Null data analysis & strategy)

3. Identifying anomalies and outliers

4. Basic descriptive statistics (describe())

5. Exploratory visualization (distribution & passenger analysis)

🎯 Objective:

1. Understand the quality and structure of the dataset

2. Detect unusual patterns (e.g., trips with 0 passengers, etc.)

3. Provide insights and recommendations before moving to machine learning models
